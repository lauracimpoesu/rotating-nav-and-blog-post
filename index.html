        <h1>Why Everybody Loves Golden Retrievers</h1>
        <small>by Laura Cimpoesu</small>
        <p>
          Goldens have something special when it comes to canine healing arts
          and has chosen the breed, all AKC registered. Their calming aura is
          warms all hearts. We call them a comfort rug with a heartbeat. Goldens
          are great listeners, they show unconditional love, they’re
          confidential, they don’t take notes and they’re nonjudgmental. On top
          of that, they are versatile, able to function in all kinds of
          situations, with people ranging from young children to elderly
          Alzheimer’s patients. They can master many skills, and will work for
          multiple handlers. Their quick minds—and background as gundogs—allow
          them to concentrate in the face of distractions encountered at
          disaster sites—sirens, shouting, even with guns or other loud noises
          in the background. And, of course, there’s one other, most important
          factor: Goldens, by nature, are <strong>lovers</strong>. <br /><br />

          My beautiful Golden Retriever is the sweetest dog ever. Her name is
          Lulu Princess and she is 2 years old (young). She loves to play with
          multiple toys, go on walks and have lots of fun with mommie and daddy.
          She enjoys playing with other dogs and people as well. She's an
          incredibly social and loving Golden Retriever, just like pretty much
          they all are. I sincerely believe this is one of the best dog breeds
          ever. Golden Retrievers are a gift from God.
